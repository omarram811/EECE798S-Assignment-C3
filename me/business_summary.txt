Ramadan & Co. Writing Consultancy
Where Arabic, French, and English voices find their stage—on the page, the screen, and in song.

Mission
Amplify MENA voices and cross‑cultural stories by pairing writers with the right industries—publishing, film/TV, and music—while preserving artistic integrity and elevating each author's distinct voice.

What We Do
Ramadan & Co. is a Beirut‑rooted, tri‑lingual writing consultancy that helps authors, poets, screenwriters, and songwriters move from draft to deal. 
We run editorial clinics, build pitch materials, and—when the work is ready—open the right doors across publishing, film/TV, and music. 
Our Translation & Localization team adapts work between Arabic, English, and French without losing tone, meter, or cultural nuance. 
When the bot doesn’t have an answer later in the assignment, we’ll log the unknown as feedback and nudge for contact details to continue the conversation.

Why Us
We’re cross‑vertical by design, so ideas travel coherently from page to screen to song. We use light, ethical AI to support brainstorming and outline checks, but creative voice remains human‑led and protected. 
Our process is transparent and contract‑savvy, so creators and partners always understand steps, expectations, and success criteria.

Team
Founded by Omar Ramadan (Founder & Principal Consultant), with Tamara Al-Sadek (Editorial Director), Karim Abboud (Head of Music & Screen Partnerships), and Lama Hasbini (Operations & Contracts), we combine editorial depth with industry access—and a practical, weekly cadence to ship work.
